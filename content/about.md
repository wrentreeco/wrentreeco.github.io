# About Me
Experienced IT professional with over 18 years of experience with MSPs and corporate IT, most recently with a cutting-edge AI company as well as a global medical device manufacturing company, designing, implementing, and managing IT environments. I got started with computers in the old days with green screen 5.25" floppy disk powered computers, dial up internet, and AOL. I have always had a passion for tinkering, computers, and breaking systems (computers, networks, physical security) and have spent a good chunk of my career and free time doing so. Bypassing physical security systems is what I find most fascinating and exhilarating in this space.

<br><br>

Outside of work, I spend time building open-source tech solutions, [reading](../books), playing video games (space flight sims are my jam right now), working on my private pilot license, gardening, and tending to the chickens. Current project is building out a solar powered off-grid office/workshop space for all of my tinkering. This space will serve as not only my office for my day job but as a space to work on 3D printing, electronics, IOT devices, homelab, and integrating technology in to community building and support, gardening, farming, and homesteading. I am very passionate about leveraging technology to build and strengthen local communities, decrease wage slavery, and reducing dependence on capitalism and government systems.
